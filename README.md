# Zootopia API Animal Explorer

This Python-based project connects to the [API Ninjas Animal API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/animals) and retrieves real animal data based on user input. It dynamically generates an HTML page displaying animal profiles, including diet, type, and location.

Built as part of Masterschoolâ€™s frontend exercises, the code showcases modular architecture, clean API handling, and HTML generation via templates.
