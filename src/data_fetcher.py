"""
    Your data_fetcher.py script is responsible for talking to the external API, grabbing detailed animal data based on a name you give it, and returning that data to the rest of your program‚Äîall in a clean, modular way.

üîç In plain terms, here‚Äôs what it does:
Takes in an animal name like "lion", "armadillo", or "goadohjasgfas"

Calls the API Ninjas service using that name and your API key

Receives the data back from the server:

For valid animals, it returns a list of dictionaries containing:

Name

Taxonomy (like genus, order, etc.)

Locations

Characteristics

For nonexistent animals or errors:

It returns an empty list

And prints a little diagnostic message to your console

This function doesn‚Äôt care what you do with the data afterward‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to just fetch. That keeps your logic split into two roles:

data_fetcher.py = the librarian

animals_web_generator.py = the artist

ü¶ä Why It‚Äôs Awesome
Keeps your code modular, so you can later plug in fake data, a local JSON file, or a different API‚Äîwithout touching your web generator logic

Makes it super easy to test and isolate bugs, because the fetcher isn‚Äôt tangled up in HTML

Follows the coding principle of separation of concerns‚Äîsomething even senior engineers rely on
